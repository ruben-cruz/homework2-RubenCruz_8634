# Homework 2

This week we're going to be writing some HTML and CSS.

Go to `https://blog.groupbuddies.com`, you should now see a list of articles.
The goal of this exercise is to "copy" (the style, not the code) this page using
only HTML and CSS.

**Mandatory goals**:

1) Look very similar to the original

2) Have more than one example articles

3) HTML should focus on structure and be semantic

4) CSS should be the only thing giving style

## FAQ

1) Should I write CSS inline?

No. This is what inline CSS looks like:

```
<div style="color: red;">Some content</div>
```

You should not do this, unless you are styling an email message.
